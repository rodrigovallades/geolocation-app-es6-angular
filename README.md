# UI Challenge - Geolocation App #

## About my solution

This app uses `webpack`, `AngularJS` and `ES6 + Babel`.

I had to learn how the Google Maps Javascript API works. I'm working with a single instance, adding markers and removing markers on the fly without re-instantiating the map. I'm also using fitBounds to make all markers visible at the same time (zoom out). I made sure that the application works in different view sizes.

## Requirements

* Node.js
* npm

## Libraries, tools and technologies

`webpack`, `ES6`, `Babel`, `AngularJS`, `sass`, `Bootstrap`, `UnderscoreJS`, `BEM`

## How to run

* `npm install` to install all dependencies.
* `npm start` to run project.
